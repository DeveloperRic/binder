# Binder
Consolidate all your files on the cloud.

Binder is a web app made up of a Node.js server backend and an Angularjs frontend. Its purpose is to create a single location where you can view files from different storage providers. It is not a provider in itself, it's just a window to other providers.

You can view the live web-app at [binderapp.xyz](https://binderapp.xyz)

### Warnings

The project is currently in beta, which means it's useable but still not stable.
Please do not attempt to use Binder as a production-level app because it is not there yet.
I also cannot guarantee the security of any of your information if you choose to use Binder, however, I have taken steps to try and increase security.

**I do not give permission to use any code within Binder _(except open-sourced code that is not mine)_. The only reason Binder is on GitHub is for version control and to showcase the project. The code and design are strictly mine.**
